# Backlog

Ideas and follow-ups captured during on-vehicle testing, not yet done. Roughly ordered by
how concrete they are.

## Volume

- **Pin Android media volume to 100% and never change it.** The effective volume is the
  head-unit stage (`wits_mcu:1`, ~67 % on the dial), which the user confirmed *does* change
  Spotify's loudness. Android's own `STREAM_MUSIC` should sit at maximum so it is a fixed
  gain stage and only the MCU/amplifier attenuates — one volume domain, not two.
  - The vendor `AudioService` ignores stream-volume changes from any caller except
    `com.wits.pms`, and `CenterService` already pins the stream to max, so it may already be
    at 100 %. **First verify** the live `STREAM_MUSIC` level (`dumpsys audio`), then decide
    whether anything is needed.
  - If active pinning is wanted, the gate blocks a normal setter; explore whether the
    platform signature lets us set it another way, or a watcher that re-asserts max. Do NOT
    add a second user-facing volume control — the user explicitly does not want two.

## Notification access

- **Self-grant notification access from the app** (platform build). The vendor's system
  menu for notification access is unreachable on this unit, and the grant is lost on every
  reinstall, so it currently needs ADB. With the platform signature we can hold
  `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS` and append our listener component to
  `enabled_notification_listeners` ourselves. The Settings → Media button should do this
  when privileged, falling back to the system intent otherwise. (Manifest permission +
  `MediaSessionRepository.grantSelf()`.)

## Cockpit / panel polish

- **Flicker artifact in Spotify's top-left, just under the status bar** — seen only with
  Spotify tiled, not Maps. Likely a freeform caption/handle or a Spotify overlay redrawing.
  Investigate whether the freeform tile shows a caption bar we can suppress.
- **Cockpit app switching flickers slightly** on change. Acceptable now; revisit if it
  bothers.
- **Blue top strip in Cockpit** — reported, then found the panel is actually black and not
  showing through. Re-check only if it reappears.
- **Panel reservation handles only a left-anchored map.** With the map swapped to the right,
  the reserve-left logic returns 0 and the panel goes full-width (content then risks sitting
  under the map). Make the reservation side-aware, or fix the map to one side.

## UI

- **"Your layouts" cards** could flow into the same adaptive grid as Home (currently a
  single column).
- **Cockpit layout** — user mentioned wanting to rearrange the blocks (clock / media / apps
  / hotspot); gather specifics.
- **Name check** — "Cockpit" is the working name for Mode B; confirm or change.

## Verified working on the vehicle (for reference, not backlog)

- Side-by-side tiling via the privileged `resizeTask` / freeform-launch path, offset correct
  under the 99 px status bar.
- Cockpit opens with the map floating and in-panel app switching.
- Dark theme follows the system setting.
